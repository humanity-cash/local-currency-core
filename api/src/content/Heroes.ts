    text: "Original Native American inhabitants of these lands and waterways prior to European settlement. Their responsible stewardship of our environment recalls our obligation to respect and care for our living ecology. A township was granted to tribe members in 1736 in today’s Stockbridge and West Stockbridge. These lands were later lost to white settlement through mortgage, debt, and sometimes fraud, and the group eventually accepted an offer of removal, and today’s Stockbridge-Munsee Band is centered around a reservation in Wisconsin. They still look to the Berkshires as a part of their ancestral homeland.",
