  //   text: `Beth Carlson and Kip Beacco are helping to digitize the Berkshires' small business community. Through their multimedia creative agency Silo Media, they specialize in graphic design, video production, website design, and social media marketing management. Their "Fresh Start” service analyzes a business's online presence and offers areas for improvement to provide visitors a more engaging experience. Even more than advertising, a strong online profile is the most important thing for a business, Beth says, as it's the first place people go to find out about your business. This has become particularly true since the onset of COVID.\n\nKip, who is also the lead guitarist for jazz swing band The Lucky 5, has always been involved in creative pursuits. In college, he studied journalism, dabbled in video production, and then launched his career in graphic design. Beth came to the Berkshires with a psychology degree and landed in the Berkshire shuffle. She has used her instinctive community organizing skills to help tell the stories of various initiatives in the region, most recently as a board member of Dewey Hall and the Clinton Church Restoration Project. Beth and Kip joined forces as the result of a mutual love of American roots music. They met while working on Oldtone, a local roots music festival co-founded by Kip, and found their working styles to be complementary: Beth frames a story around the big picture while Kip's practical skills implement the vision.\n\nThey consider themselves visual minimalists and offer simple, clean, and contemporary styles. You can see this in their work around town: the logos for One Mercantile and the Great Barrington Bagel Company, the Berkshires Farm Table Cookbook, or fundraising videos for Construct and Flying Cloud. One of their latest documentary pursuits is in collaboration with chef and culinary consultant Katy Sparks on a farm-to-table video project called the "Edible Natural World” in which Katy interviews farmers and food producers and then cooks with their products to paint a holistic picture of the movement. Their initial segments feature Molly Comstock of Colfax Farm and Elizabeth Keen of Indian Line Farm.\n\nEach project varies depending on the industry, the client, or the medium; there's no one-size-fits-all approach. Kip and Beth like to start by sitting down with the client to better understand their mission, goals, and audience. They pride themselves on transparency and communication in regard to project timelines and deliverables. Whether they're handed the reins for creative liberty or are collaborating with a hands-on client or multiple decision-makers, they always end up with a product that reflects the client's values and aesthetics.\n\nWhen it comes to growing their business, Kip and Beth have their sights set on the changing landscape of Main Street. With new shops come new opportunities to tell stories and enrich the online presence of small businesses. To newcomers and aspiring entrepreneurs, they offer the notion of diversification of product and service offerings, media formats, and even payment options, like BerkShares! "The Berkshires are fertile ground for collaboration,” Beth reflects, and tools like our local currency help to facilitate cooperation between businesses by providing an incentive to shop with each other. "Our downtowns are thriving again,” Kip adds. The time is right to start a business and they can't wait to tell your story.\n\nSilo Media\n\ninfo@silo-media.com\n\n413.429.1176`,

    text: `Laughter is the best currency (next to BerkShares) and no one knows that better than Roger Reed. Roger the Jester, as he's more commonly known, is the mime character into whom Roger transforms when performing for global audiences at birthday parties, galas, festivals, and other celebratory events. He first emerged on the streets of Boston in the mid-1970s, then known as Roger the New Renaissance Jester. He hustled to make a name for himself, saying, "if the sun was out, so was I.” Even when he didn't make much money from a day of performing, merely making people laugh was enough to be considered worthwhile.\n\nHis college experience put him on a career path as a photojournalist, but he felt unfulfilled after a year in the field. Having grown up watching Red Skelton and other television variety shows, he understood the structure of a well-curated comedy show and as a natural jokester himself, he considered it a plausible career prospect. He discovered Tony Montanaro's Celebration Barn Theater in South Paris, Maine, and went there to learn the ways of the mime. He then traveled with improv troupes, but grew tired of the organized group and dialogue-filled performances. As a self-described introvert, Roger can take up space as the center of attention during his sole mime act while not having to bother with small talk or changing social dynamics. With this vision in mind, he set off to "recreate the wandering lifestyle of a medieval fool.”\n\nNothing brings him more joy than having an audience member from the early days of his 49-year-old career return with their children and grandchildren. A typical show involves juggling, musical instruments, magic tricks, and funny faces, and while Roger's tactics haven't changed much over the years, each show is unique and tailored to its audience members. There are no dress rehearsals and, in fact, his improvisational skills are necessary to simultaneously satisfy a wide range of ages and maturity levels.\n\nRoger has traveled to over 25 countries to incite laughter. Following the 2005 earthquake in Haiti, Roger staged a comic relief effort to lift the spirits of those affected called "Jester Relief.” He recalls an aid worker validating his work when she introduced him to laughter as one of the "Seven Steps to Survival” espousing the importance of lifting the spirit in order to overcome traumatic scenarios and disasters. Even if only in a satirical or ironic way, there's a comical side to everything, Roger says, "I see funny stuff that happens all the time.”\n\nLuckily for Roger, he doesn't have to travel too far from home these days to find new audiences. With the changing demographics in the Berkshires, new residents are discovering Roger for the first time. It's just as well because he loves supporting local economic activities like accepting BerkShares for his performances, shopping locally, and participating in a local CSA farm share.\n\nRoger concludes each show with the following quote, "Laugh yourself heartily and you will feel better. Make your friend laugh and you'll make him happier. Make your enemy laugh and he will hate you less. Make the desponding laugh and you'll raise their hopes. Make the sorrowful laugh and you'll give them hope. Make the old laugh and you'll make them younger. Make the child laugh and you'll make them happier, healthy, and more loving.” At the end of the show, everyone's a kid, he says. Everyone loves to laugh, play, and be amused, and Roger excels at drawing out the inner child in everyone.`,
